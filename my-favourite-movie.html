            <h1>My favourite movie</h1>
            <section> 
                <p1>The best movie ever made is a mvoie about nothing at all. 
                <br>This movie being Dazed and Confused, a movie set in the 70's about the 70's.
                <br>It follows a group of schoolkids on their last day of school in the year 1977.

                <h2>Why is it my favourite movie?</h2>

                    <p2>Who knows ey, for some reason 70's music clothing and all in all attitude just speaks to this lad.
                    <br> I saw this music for the first time at around the age of 15 just about when I got my first record player and got into spending my pocket money on vinyls. 
                    <br> I remember watching it due to a site online recommending it as a comperatively good movie to the show freaks and geeks.
                    <br>I put it on on my laptop and right after watching it for the first time I just put it on again, something I'd never done before and have never done since.

                    <br>

                    <p3>I must have watch Dazed and confused a total of 70 times by now and can quite confidently quote most of it woith voices and all. 
                    one of the big reasons I just keep putting the movie on is the sound track, which I too have on vinyl. <br>It's a perect list of mainstream 70's rock from Bob Dylan's Hurricane to Dr. John's right place wrong time. 
                    The Movie is recognised these days mainly for it being the first appearance of Matthew McConaughey in an acting roll. <br> With that also being the first time he ever says his most famous line ever, "alright alright alright"

              <h3>Two of my favourite clips from the movie</h3>

              <p4>These clips are easily my favourite, though for very different reasons. 
                  <br> This first one I just love because of the deliverence of the line "watch the leather man". 
                  <br> This voice plus the manurism is something I catch myself copying in my day to day life...
                  <br> For the second video it's pure vibe, the way it just is. The way I'd want to be there, the clothes, the music, the bar they're at.
